Fueltrac Mockup
====

[Demo here](http://balsamade.com/fueltrac-mockup/ "Fueltrac Mockup") 

An ultra lightweight (<50KB), yet attractive responsive homepage with SVG images and animation. It can serve as a good base for building projects.

Uses:
- Zurb Foundation 5 grid
- Bourbon for the SCSS animation mixins
- Responsive-nav.js (@viljamis) 

Todo:
- Older IE compatability
- PNG fallback for SVG images on older IE
- Simple modal overlay for video
