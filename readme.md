Fueltrac Homepage
====

[Demo here](http://balsamade.com/fueltrac-mockup/ "Fueltrac homepage mockup") 

An ultra lightweight (<50KB), yet attractive responsive homepage with SVG images and animation. It can serve as a good base for building projects.

The design was adapted from an old static design I did that was rejected in favour of [this](http://fueltrac.com.au/ "Fueltrac website") 

Uses:
- Zurb Foundation 5 grid
- Bourbon for the SCSS animation mixins
- Responsive-nav.js (@viljamis)

Todo:
- Older IE compatibility
- PNG fallback for SVG images on older IE
- Simple modal overlay for video
