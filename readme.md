# Fueltrac Homepage

A lightweight (<20KB), yet attractive, responsive homepage with SVG images and CSS animation. 
[Loads blazingly fast (less than half a second)](https://tools.pingdom.com/#!/e6X62/https://seanockert.com/projects/fueltrac/ "Pingdom tools results") and can serve as a good base for small sites.

## Demo
https://seanockert.com/projects/fueltrac/

## Uses
- Zurb Foundation 5 grid
- Responsive-nav.js (@viljamis)
- Gulp taskrunner to compile the project

## Reason
The design was adapted from an old static design I did that was rejected in favour of [this](http://fueltrac.com.au/ "Fueltrac website") 

## Todo:
- PNG fallback for SVG images on older IE
- Lightweight modal overlay for video
